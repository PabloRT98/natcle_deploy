== Description ==

Rate my Post is a lightweight, responsive and free WordPress rating plugin which allows you to quickly and easily add rating widgets to your posts and pages. You can add rating widget to your posts and pages with a shortcode or automatically in plugin settings (every post/every page, below the content). The plugin also comes with results widget which can be added automatically, above the content of your posts, or manually with a shortcode.

The plugin has also stats section where you can see how many votes each post/page received and what is its average rating. It also allows you to change ratings from backend and supports structured data for rich snippets. Analytics section allows you to see the details about each vote on your website.

What sets Rate my Post apart from other WordPress rating plugins is its simplicity, performance and impact on engagement. It works with any page cache plugin and is probably the most customizable free WordPress rating plugin.

The plugin also features Top Rated Posts widget which displays top rated posts according to your settings.

It does not require any web development skills. However, the plugin is also perfect for developers as it comes with neat hooks. Check out the [documentation](https://blazzdev.com/documentation/rate-my-post-documentation/) to learn more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Support? =
For support use the support forum, but please do read the guidelines before posting.
= Does it work with caching plugins? =
The plugin works with all caching plugin. If you are using caching plugin other than WP Super Cache, LiteSpeed Cache, WP Fastest Cache, WP Rocket or SG Optimizer, you should enable AJAX load results in the advanced settings.
= What can be rated? =
The plugin allows visitors to rate posts, pages and custom post types. It is not possible to rate archives (categories etc.) as the ratings are stored in the post meta.
= The rating widget is displayed multiple times =
This typically happens with various "page builder" themes. In such cases it's best to include the rating widget with the shortcode [ratemypost] instead of using the automatic option. If that's too much work, you can add it directly to the template of your theme. See the procedure in the [documentation](https://blazzdev.com/documentation/rate-my-post-documentation/) under Troubleshooting -> The “Add rating widget to all posts” feature is not working.
= Can I have more than one rating widget on a single web page? =
Currently it's not possible to have more than one rating widget on a single web page. Nevertheless, this will be changed in the future versions.
= Where do I find the documentation =
The documentation is available [here](https://blazzdev.com/documentation/rate-my-post-documentation/).
= The vote count and average rating are not correct on page load =
Such issues typically appear due to caching. If you are encountering such issues enable Ajax load results in the advanced settings.
= The plugin stopped working after the update =
If you encounter problems with the plugin after an update, first clear the cache (page cache, minify cache, CDN cache such as CloudFlare etc.). Then open an incognito window and see if the problem has been solved. In case it hasn't don't hesitate to contact me via the support forum.
= I can't save the settings =
If you have trouble saving the settings, clear your browser cache. Such problems typically appear after the update because the browser is still serving old files from cache.
= Does it work with multilingual websites? =
Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with multilingual websites. If you are using the plugin on a multilingual website enable Multilingual website compatibility mode in the advanced settings and then translate strings through your plugin for translations.
= Do I have to translate the plugin if my website uses language other than English? =
Not necessarily because the plugin allows you to customize all frontend strings in the settings. However, backend strings can only be translated with translation files.
= Does this plugin show rich snippets? =
The plugin adds structured data for rich snippets, if you enable this option in the settings. Note that since September 2019 Google Shows rich snippets only for the following structured data types: Product, Book, Course, CreativeWorkSeason, CreativeWorkSeries, Episode, Game, LocalBusiness, MediaObject, Movie, MusicPlaylist, MusicRecording, Organization, Recipe, HowTo, SoftwareApplication and Event. The plugin supports all these structured data types except HowTo, SoftwareApplication and Event. These can be added with a filter, but this does require some web development skills. See the [documentation](https://blazzdev.com/documentation/rate-my-post-documentation/) for more information.
= Which structured data type should I choose? =
You should choose structured data type that fits your blog posts. If your blog posts are recipes than choose Recipe; if they are courses select Course etc. In case your blog posts don't fit any structured data type, than you are according to Google Guidelines not eligible for rich snippets. Learn more about this [here](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/09/making-review-rich-results-more-helpful.html).
= Rich snippets are not showing =
If rich snippets are not showing check that structured data is valid [here](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool). If it's valid than search engines probably don't trust your website enough to show rich snippets. You can fix that by producing high-quality content.
